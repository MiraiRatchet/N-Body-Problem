# N Body problem solver with CUDA
To solve a N Body problem you can use a ready NBody.txt file or create a new one by yourself or by adjusting Create New File setting in NBodyProblem.cu.
## 4 body problem
If you are solving a 4 body problem given in 4body.txt, by using given traj.txt files you can calculate an error.
4BodyVisualize.nb uses Wolfram Mathematica to visualize traj.txt files (there is an option for writing N Body problem traj files too (use settings in the code)).

Don't forget to compile NBodyProblem.cu file!
